## What Is ShopMatch

A .net core mvvm code first project with fluent validation where people could add products to a shopping cart. 

## Project

This project is created to teach us the principle of Agile and how to complete a project using those principles. <br />
Together with 3 of my fellow students we took turns who was the product owner, sprint leader and developers. As such, we learned what to do in different positions and situations. As time past by we got better at our tasks and so we could complete this to our hearts content.<br />
I'm an absolute fan of the Agile methodology and I'm looking forward to implement this in my future projects. <br />
